abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signalling regulates cancer through mechanisms that function either within the tumour cell itself or through host-tumour cell interactions. Studies of tumour-cell-autonomous TGFbeta effects show clearly that TGFbeta signalling has a mechanistic role in tumour suppression and tumour promotion. In addition, factors in the tumour microenvironment, such as fibroblasts, immune cells and the extracellular matrix, influence the ability of TGFbeta to promote or suppress carcinoma progression and metastasis. The complex nature of TGFbeta signalling and crosstalk in the tumour microenvironment presents a unique challenge, and an opportunity to develop therapeutic intervention strategies for targeting cancer.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: PIK3CA is the oncogene showing the highest frequency of gain-of-function mutations in breast cancer, but the prognostic value of PIK3CA mutation status is controversial. METHODS: We investigated the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation status in a series of 452 patients with unilateral invasive primary breast cancer and known long-term outcome (median follow-up 10 years). RESULTS: PIK3CA mutations were identified in 151 tumors (33.4\%). The frequency of PIK3CA mutations differed markedly according to hormone receptor (estrogen receptor alpha [ER$\alpha$] and progesterone receptor [PR]) and ERBB2 status, ranging from 12.5\% in the triple-negative subgroup (ER-/PR-/ERBB2-) to 41.1\% in the HR+/ERBB2- subgroup. PIK3CA mutation was associated with significantly longer metastasis-free survival in the overall population (P = 0.0056), and especially in the PR-positive and ERBB2-positive subgroups. In Cox multivariate regression analysis, the prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutation status persisted only in the ERBB2-positive subgroup. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the high prevalence of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer. PIK3CA mutation is an emerging tumor marker which might become used in treatment-choosing process. The independent prognostic value of PIK3CA mutation status in ERBB2-positive breast cancer patients should be now confirmed in larger series of patients included in randomized prospective ERBB2-based clinical trials.},

abstract = {Although advances in genomics during the last decade have opened new avenues for translational research and allowed the direct evaluation of clinical samples, there is still a need for reliable preclinical models to test therapeutic strategies. Human cancer-derived cell lines are the most widely used models to study the biology of cancer and to test hypotheses to improve the efficacy of cancer treatment. Since the development of the first cancer cell line, the clinical relevance of these models has been continuously questioned. Based upon recent studies that have fueled the debate, we review the major events in the development of the in vitro models and the emergence of new technologies that have revealed important issues and limitations concerning human cancer cell lines as models. All cancer cell lines do not have equal value as tumor models. Some have been successful, whereas others have failed. However, the success stories should not obscure the growing body of data that motivates us to develop new in vitro preclinical models that would substantially increase the success rate of new in vitro-assessed cancer treatments.},

abstract = {RNAseq and microarray methods are frequently used to measure gene expression level. While similar in purpose, there are fundamental differences between the two technologies. Here, we present the largest comparative study between microarray and RNAseq methods to date using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found high correlations between expression data obtained from the Affymetrix one-channel microarray and RNAseq (Spearman correlations coefficients of âˆ¼0.8). We also observed that the low abundance genes had poorer correlations between microarray and RNAseq data than high abundance genes. As expected, due to measurement and normalization differences, Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data were poorly correlated (Spearman correlations coefficients of only âˆ¼0.2). By examining the differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples we observed reasonable concordance in directionality between Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data, although a small group of genes were found to have expression changes reported in opposite directions using these two technologies. Overall, RNAseq produces comparable results to microarray technologies in term of expression profiling. The RNAseq normalization methods RPKM and RSEM produce similar results on the gene level and reasonably concordant results on the exon level. Longer exons tended to have better concordance between the two normalization methods than shorter exons.},

abstract = {Several studies have correlated escape from TGF-beta-mediated cell cycle arrest with the tumorigenic phenotype. Most often, this escape from growth control has been linked to dysfunctional TGF-beta receptors or defects in the TGF-beta-mediated SMAD signaling pathway. In this report, we found that highly metastatic 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells express functional TGF-beta receptors capable of initiating SMAD-mediated transcription, yet are not growth inhibited by TGF-beta1. We further observed that TGF-beta directly contributes to the metastatic behavior of this cell line. Exposure to TGF-beta caused 4T1 cells to undergo morphological changes associated with the metastatic phenotype and invade more readily through collagen coated matrices. Furthermore, expression of a dominant negative truncated type II receptor diminished TGF-beta signaling and significantly restricted the ability of 4T1 cells to establish distant metastases. Our results suggest that regardless of 4T1 resistance to TGF-beta-mediated growth inhibition, TGF-beta signaling is required for tumor invasion and metastases formation.},

abstract = {Many studies have investigated the association between alterations in the p53 gene and clinical outcome of breast cancer, and most investigators have reported poorer overall and disease-free survival (as indicated by a relative hazard (RH) greater than one) in breast cancer cases with somatic mutations in p53. However, different studies have produced widely differing RH estimates, ranging from no risk (RH = 1) to a relative hazard of 23, and not all of these results have been statistically significant. We have therefore reviewed all the published studies that have investigated the association between somatic mutations in the p53 gene and breast cancer prognosis and used standard techniques of meta-analysis to combine the results of these studies to produce a more precise estimate of the prognostic significance of p53 mutations. Eleven studies investigated overall survival in a total of 2319 unselected cases. The RH estimates from these ranged from 1 to 23.4 with a combined RH estimate of 2.0 (confidence interval 1.7-2.5). Three studies investigated the role of p53 in node-negative patients and in these, the combined estimate of RH was 1.7 (1.2-2.3). For three studies of node-positive breast cancer the combined risk estimate was 2.6 (1.7-3.9). The inclusion of p53 mutation screening in large breast cancer clinical trials seems warranted in the light of these results. Analysis of large numbers of cases matched for stage and therapy will allow definitive clarification of the value of p53 mutational status in prognostication, and possibly choice of therapy.},

A tissue similarity index (TSI) was designed based upon singular value decomposition that measured in vivo tumor characteristic gene expression in each cell line independently. Only 34 of the 60 cell lines received the highest TSI toward its tumor of origin. In addition, we identified the most appropriate cell lines to be used as model systems for different in vivo tumors. Seven cell lines were identified as being of another origin than the originally presumed one. The proposed TSI will likely become an important tool for the selection of the most appropriate cell lines in pharmaceutical screening programs and experimental and biomedical research.},

We established a panel of 39 cell lines of various human cancers and developed a database of their chemosensitivities. Drugs were profiled in terms of their "fingerprints", patterns of differential activity against the cell lines. There was a significant correlation between a drug's fingerprint and its mode of action, as observed in the NCI panel of 60 cell lines. Therefore our cell-line panel is a powerful tool to predict the modes of action of new compounds. We have been using this system for drug discovery, coupled with various target-based drug screenings. We used the system to identify a novel DNA minor-groove binder, MS-247, which has inhibitory activity against topoisomerases I and II, and potent in vivo antitumor activity against various human cancer xenografts. We also discovered a potent novel telomerase inhibitor, FJ5002, by mining our database with the COMPARE algorithm, followed by experimental validation. We investigated the gene expression profiles of the cell lines by using DNA microarrays to find profiles determining cellular chemosensitivity and new targets for anticancer drugs. Our integrated database, including the chemosensitivities and gene expression profiles of the cell-line panel, could provide a basis for drug discovery and personalized therapy.},

abstract = {Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family members exert their function via specific type I and type II serine/threonine kinase receptors and intracellular Smad transcription factors, including the common mediator Smad4. The dual effects of TGF-beta signaling on tumor initiation and progression are cell-specific and yet to be determined under distinct contexts. A number of genetically manipulated mouse models with alterations in the TGF-beta pathway genes, particularly the pivotal Smad4, revealed that these genes play crucial functions in maintaining tissue homeostasis and suppressing tumorigenesis. Loss of Smad4 plays a causal role in initiating squamous cell carcinomas of skin and upper digestive tract as well as adenocarcinomas of gastrointestinal tract. However, for some cancers like pancreatic and cholangiocellular carcinomas, Smad4 deficiency does not initiate the tumorigenesis but acts as a promoter to accelerate or synergize the development and progression of cancers that are started by other oncogenic pathways. Intriguingly, emerging evidences from mouse models have highlighted the important roles of non-cell autonomous effects of Smad4-mediated TGF-beta signaling in the inhibition of oncogenesis. All these data have greatly deepened our understanding of molecular mechanisms of cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous effect of Smad4-mediated TGF-beta signaling in suppressing carcinogenesis, which may facilitate the development of successful therapies targeting TGF-beta signaling for the treatment of human cancers.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mammaglobin A (SCGB2A2) and lipophilin B (SCGB1D2), two members of the secretoglobin superfamily, are known to be co-expressed in breast cancer, where their proteins form a covalent complex. Based on the relatively high tissue-specific expression pattern, it has been proposed that the mammaglobin A protein and/or its complex with lipophilin B could be used in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. In view of these clinical implications, the aim of the present study was to analyze the expression of both genes in a large panel of human solid tumors (n = 309), corresponding normal tissues (n = 309) and cell lines (n = 11), in order to evaluate their tissue specific expression and co-expression pattern. METHODS: For gene and protein expression analyses, northern blot, dot blot hybridization of matched tumor/normal arrays (cancer profiling arrays), quantitative RT-PCR, non-radioisotopic RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used. RESULTS: Cancer profiling array data demonstrated that mammaglobin A and lipophilin B expression is not restricted to normal and malignant breast tissue. Both genes were abundantly expressed in tumors of the female genital tract, i.e. endometrial, ovarian and cervical cancer. In these four tissues the expression pattern of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B was highly concordant, with both genes being down-, up- or not regulated in the same tissue samples. In breast tissue, mammaglobin A expression was down-regulated in 49\% and up-regulated in 12\% of breast tumor specimens compared with matching normal tissues, while lipophilin B was down-regulated in 59\% and up-regulated in 3\% of cases. In endometrial tissue, expression of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B was clearly up-regulated in tumors (47\% and 49\% respectively). Both genes exhibited down-regulation in 22\% of endometrial tumors. The only exceptions to this concordance of mammaglobin A/lipophilin B expression were normal and malignant tissues of prostate and kidney, where only lipophilin B was abundantly expressed and mammaglobin A was entirely absent. RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry confirmed expression of mammaglobin A on a cellular level in endometrial and cervical cancer and their corresponding normal tissues. CONCLUSION: Altogether, these data suggest that expression of mammaglobin A and lipophilin B might be controlled in different tissues by the same regulatory transcriptional mechanisms. Diagnostic assays based on mammaglobin A expression and/or the mammaglobin A/lipophilin B complex appear to be less specific for breast cancer, but with a broader spectrum of potential applications, which includes gynecologic malignancies.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Molecular classification of breast cancer has been proposed based on gene expression profiles of human tumors. Luminal, basal-like, normal-like, and erbB2+ subgroups were identified and were shown to have different prognoses. The goal of this research was to determine if these different molecular subtypes of breast cancer also respond differently to preoperative chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Fine needle aspirations of 82 breast cancers were obtained before starting preoperative paclitaxel followed by 5-fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Gene expression profiling was done with Affymetrix U133A microarrays and the previously reported "breast intrinsic" gene set was used for hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to assign molecular class. RESULTS: The basal-like and erbB2+ subgroups were associated with the highest rates of pathologic complete response (CR), 45\% [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI), 24-68] and 45\% (95\% CI, 23-68), respectively, whereas the luminal tumors had a pathologic CR rate of 6\% (95\% CI, 1-21). No pathologic CR was observed among the normal-like cancers (95\% CI, 0-31). Molecular class was not independent of conventional cliniocopathologic predictors of response such as estrogen receptor status and nuclear grade. None of the 61 genes associated with pathologic CR in the basal-like group were associated with pathologic CR in the erbB2+ group, suggesting that the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy sensitivity may vary between these two estrogen receptor-negative subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The basal-like and erbB2+ subtypes of breast cancer are more sensitive to paclitaxel- and doxorubicin-containing preoperative chemotherapy than the luminal and normal-like cancers.},
